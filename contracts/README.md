# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help

//Test:
npx hardhat test

//Compile after changes:
npx hardhat compile

//Run node:
npx hardhat node

//Make sure that .ignition/parameters.json is updated with the correct params

//Deploy the contract:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts   

//Copy .artifacts/contracts/Lock.sol/Lock.json abi list to frontend/src/utils/Lock_ABI.json

//Copy deployed address to frontend/src/utils/constants.ts

//Test with gas report:
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test



```
